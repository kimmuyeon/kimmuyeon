## 🧠 Interests  

- **Computer Vision**:  
  My focus lies in developing techniques that advance **Object Detection**, **Image Segmentation**, and particularly **Keypoint Detection**. I am deeply interested in extracting meaningful features and identifying critical points in images to solve real-world problems, such as motion analysis, pose estimation, and medical image analysis.

- **Healthcare Projects**:  
  Passionate about applying AI to **medical diagnostics** and **healthcare automation**, I aim to develop AI models that tackle critical healthcare problems, such as disease detection, medical image analysis (e.g., X-rays, MRIs), and predictive analytics for patient care.

- **Deep Learning**:  
  I enjoy building **robust and explainable models** using frameworks like **PyTorch**. My focus is on improving model performance while ensuring interpretability through methods such as **Grad-CAM**, **SHAP**, and attention mechanisms to bridge the gap between AI solutions and real-world usability in healthcare.
